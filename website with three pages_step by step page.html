	<h1>Steps:</h1><br/>
	<p>
		<h3>1. Provide a Context</h3>
		Providing a context allows chatGPT to provide your querries with answers exactly how you want it.<br/>
		Our friend is so smart that if you don't provide such a context it will give you probably too much<br/>
		than you are looking for. Here is an example: "multiply 643.82893923 by 484.48394893 and leave the <br/>
		answer in three decimal places". So in our example above our context is the part that says "leave the<br/>
		answer in three decimal places". The remaining 5 decimal places will be rounded of and, then we get<br/>
		answer like this 311,924.77
	</p><br/>
	<p>
		<h3>2. Give it Examples</h3>
		let's understand this by expanding our example above."Multiply 643.82893923 by 484.48394893 and leave the<br/> 
		answer in three decimal places. Example: 22.1111 multiplied by 33.2222 = 734.58". The example provides a<br/>
		format that our super ai should present us with our answer<br/>
	</p><br/>
	<p>
		<h3>3. Refine your Results</h3>
		lets assume you wanted the results to be in two decimal places but you didn't want it rounded off. You can <br/>
		just simply refine the results by putting in another querry like this: "thanks but just leave it in two<br/>
		decimal places without rounding it off". So the 732.58 result it gave you will be changed to 732.57<br/>
	</p><br/>
	<p>
		All that was super easy right! Now you know how to get the best out of ChatGPT. Cheers!<br/>
